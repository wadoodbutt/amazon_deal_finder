# amazon_deal_finder
This program allows the user to enter a product that would be found on Amazon (anything legal basically) and find the best deals
for that product! It utilizes an algorithm that intakes the data (via priceapi.com) from Amazon, sorts it by price, and finds the top
deals for that product. Once that is compiled, it is then sent to the user (via Twilio API) through SMS text with the price and link
to the product. This is can be ran every day using the cloud (pythonanywhere.com).
